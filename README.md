# hangman
Just another project with Jetbrains Academy to make a basic hangman game. 

There are alot of files in here outside of what I've written, as it includes many test files from Jetbrains Academy. The project file can be found in the following path - 
hangman > Hangman > Hangman > task > hangman

There are also problems that I solved while working on this project. Those can be found in the following path - 
hangman > Hangman > Problems
